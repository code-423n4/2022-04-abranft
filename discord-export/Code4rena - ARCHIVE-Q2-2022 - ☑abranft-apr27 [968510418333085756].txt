Could you share more about how the bentoBox works with the NFT pair contract ?


[04/27/2022 5:04 AM] pedroais
What are these shares representing and why are you using them for loan amounts ?

The BentoBox allows for funds to be invested in strategies - like Yearn vaults, for instance. If you deposit funds (ERC-20 tokens) into the BentoBox, you get a number of "shares", in proportion to your deposit, and the actual tokens may get invested. If the strategy profits, your shares become correspondingly more valuable.

Not every ERC-20 has a strategy; if there is none, the amount:share ratio will simply be 1:1.

This "shares" business is just how the BentoBox tracks balances, and protocols using it have to be aware. To some extent, the BentoBox handles these conversions and you can deal in absolute amounts. For instance, deposits and withdrawals can be specified in either shares or amounts. 

Knowing that these calculations occur, and that shares is the "true" quantity and the other involves rounding, it makes sense to do calculations such as "take X% as fee" in Bento shares, given the choice.


[04/27/2022 6:03 AM] barry_lyndon
Loan amounts, however, are actual "amounts", not shares -- how much you owe does/should not depend on how some strategy the lender may choose to invest in, performs. 

If you take out a loan, you get Bento shares corresponding to the amount you want to borrow (minus a fee). When you repay, you owe however many Bento shares the amount due (principal  + interest) corresponds to.


[04/27/2022 6:07 AM] barry_lyndon
(If you as a borrower want tokens rather than shares, you can choose to convert them -- withdraw from Bento -- immediately, or use `cook()` to do it in one transaction. An UI could of course facilitate this)

Thank you that's very helpful

I'd be really interested in hearing more about how Abracadabra uses _actions_. In particular, I'd love to know more about how `value1` and `value2` (returned from earlier actions) can be used in later actions. Could you let us know about some typical use cases? Better yet, are there any links to documentation of the action feature?


[04/28/2022 10:14 AM] 100proof
Also, what is "skimming" all about?


[04/28/2022 3:47 PM] barry_lyndon
OK, I've had a few questions about `skim` now.

- What does skim do?

If you set skim to true, you are telling the contract that you have already transfered the ERC-20 tokens, or the NFT, and there is no need to take it from your account.

The contract owns a certain amount of funds and NFTs: every NFT that is being used as collateral in a loan, or loan request, and fees that have been collected as ERC-20 token. It knows which NFTs, and it knows how much it collected in fees (minus withdrawals by the protocol owners). 

Anything in excess of that must have somehow been transfered in. To "skim" is to treat that excess as your deposit. Whether it was actually you that did this or someone else, is not the contract's problem. The excess is fair game for anyone to take. The envisioned use case is to do it in a transaction: you have tokens somewhere, and rather than withdrawing them to your wallet (or BentoBox account), and then depositing them here, you just get them sent directly to the contract. This can either be done via the cook() method on NFTPair, or of course by some other contract that you control.


[04/28/2022 4:20 PM] barry_lyndon
Actions allow for some measure of programmability by just calling the contract. In particular, it allows for more elaborate interactions from a UI.

To be honest, they have not been a priority so far, other than as potential attack vectors, and will likely see some additions in the future.

The most common use case is not very exciting, but useful nonetheless: to seemlessly handle BentoBox deposits and withdrawals. Another would be to do batches of loans and/or loan requests.

Neither of these uses return values. A big one that would, had we implemented it, would be to deposit the exact amount required for a repayment into the BentoBox, and then repay the loan. Here, ACTION_BENTO_DEPOSIT would use the result of an interest rate calculation, which did not make it into the contract yet (as a cook action).

And even that one a) does not allow more advanced "branching" features effected by using the negative range of inputs, and b) has its usefulness capped by the amount of "dust" that you lose if you just calculate the interest beforehand and slightly overshoot it to allow for the transaction to process.


[04/28/2022 4:20 PM] barry_lyndon
So tl;dr: it's there, it allows for some programmability from the UI, but we have not got any super exciting use cases for it. It may well turn out that anything sufficiently exciting, warrants its own external contract.
